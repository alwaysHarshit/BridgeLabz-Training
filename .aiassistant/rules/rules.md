AI-Pattern Avoidance Strategies
Dynamic Logic Flow: Instead of always using a standard for loop, I will occasionally use while loops or specialized stream API if it fits the context naturally.

Comment Realism: AI typically comments every single line (e.g., // Initialize scanner). I will only use comments for complex logic or section breaks, making the code look like it was written by a developer who knows what they are doing.

Variable Context: Instead of generic names like num1 or temp, I will use context-aware names based on the problem (e.g., initialBalance, retryCount).

Alternat
ive Syntax: AI tends to use the most "standard" library methods. I will occasionally use alternative but efficient ways to handle logic (e.g., using printf for formatted output instead of complex string concatenation).

: Do not include sc.close(); in the code, as per your specific requirement.
 do not write genreric print system . write human like print statements
